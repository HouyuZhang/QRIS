## Introduction
Retrovirus threatens the host cell by integrating its DNA into the host genome that leads to detrimental expansion. The integration site selection is a vital step during this process to determine its fate. Many efforts were made to understand its integration specificity and found diverse DNA sequence preferences across retroviruses genera. However, the effect of genome-wide DNA structural properties, like DNA shapes, on retrovirus integration was less clear. 

We systematically investigated this issue on six types of retroviruses that are representative of four genera. Here we devised **QRIS (Quantify the Retrovirus Integration Specificity)**, a machine learning framework to assess the DNA shape effect on large-scale retro-viruses integration sites. We found the DNA shape can independently or cooperatively work with DNA motif to regulate retrovirus integration. Based on this, we classified these retroviruses into three categories: StrongProne retrovirus, WeakProne retrovirus, and Strongshape retro-virus. Interestingly, the Strongshape retrovirus can gain specificity through DNA shapes even without a particular DNA motif preference. 

Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation of DNA shape and DNA sequence revealed their diverse roles in regulating the retrovirus integration specificity. Our findings may help more precisely control the lentivirus vector for gene therapy and disturb the retrovirus integration during the pathogenic process in the future.

## Scripts organization

- Script head with series number (R1, R2, R3, R4) is for specific analysis follows the Results order in the mainn text.

  Specifically, the `bash script` and `python script` is for processing data and corresponding `R scripts` is used for downstream analysis, statistics and plotting.
